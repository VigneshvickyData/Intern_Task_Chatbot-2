# Task 2: Developing a Medical Q&A Chatbot using the MedQuAD Dataset

## Final Report


### 1. Introduction
The aim of this was to develop a medical Q&A chatbot using the MedQuAD dataset.The chatbot is designed to retrieve relevant answers to user queries and incorporate basic medical entity recognition, such as symptoms, diseases, and treatments.Additionally,the chatbot includes a simple, interactive interface created with Streamlit to enchance usability.

### 2. Background
with the growing need for accessible and accurete healthcare information, medical chatbots are becoming increasingly important. They provide users with a convenient way to ask medical questions and receive trustworthy answers. The MedQuAD dataset, sourced from reputable medical organizations, serves as the foundation for this chatbot, enabling it to deliver precise and context-aware responses

Dataset:
* The MedQuAD dataset, used for Task 2, was sourced from GitHub.
